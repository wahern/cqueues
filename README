== BUILD DEPENDENCIES ==

The Makefile requires GNU Make. The source code should build with recent
GCC, clang, or Solaris SunPro compilers.

If you use your own Makefile, note that GCC and especially clang may emit
copious warnings about initializers and unused parameters. These warnings
are stupid. Use -Wno-override-init (GCC), -Wno-initializer-overrides (clang)
and -Wno-unused to quiet these. For other warnings, patches welcome.

M4 and awk are required to generate errno.c. It relies on mk/errno.list to
enumerate the system error macro names. mk/errno.list is a small
POSIX-compatible shell script. By default it processes GCC's -dM macro list
(clang also supports this option). For SunPro it uses a slightly cruder
method.

Because the location of Lua 5.2 and LuaJIT include headers are completely
random across systems, the build system relies on mk/lua.path to locate the
correct headers, including selecting the correct headers at compile-time
when conflicting headers are encountered. mk/lua.path uses various POSIX
utilities. For more information, see

	http://25thandclement.com/~william/projects/luapath.html

cqueues should work (plus or minus a few tweaks) on recent versions of
Linux, OS X, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and derivatives. The only
other possible candidate is AIX, if and when support for AIX's pollset
interface is added to the embedded "kpoll" library.


== BUILD OVERVIEW ==

There is no separate ./configure step. System introspection occurs during
compile-time. However, the `configure' Make target can be used to cache the
build environment.


== BUILD ENVIRONMENT ==

All the common GNU-style installation path variables are supported,
including prefix, bindir, libdir, datadir, includedir, and DESTDIR. These
additional path variables are also allowed:

lua51path  - install path for Lua 5.1 modules, e.g. $(prefix)/share/lua/5.1
lua51cpath - install path for Lua 5.1 C modules, e.g. $(prefix)/lib/lua/5.1
lua52path  - install path for Lua 5.2 modules, e.g. $(prefix)/share/lua/5.2
lua52cpath - install path for Lua 5.2 C modules, e.g. $(prefix)/lib/lua/5.2

All the common GNU-style compiler variables are supported, including CC,
CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and SOFLAGS. Note that you can specify the path
to both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2 include headers at the same time in CPPFLAGS;
the build system will work things out to ensure the correct headers are
loaded at compile-time.

Invoking the `configure' target will cache the Make environment and reload
the variable values on subsequent invocations. Variables can be modified on
an individual basis after this.


== BUILD TARGETS ==

cqueues targets both the Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.1 (LuaJIT) API. For various
reasons the build system is capable of building both 5.1 and 5.2 modules
simultaneously in a single Make invocation. Therefore, there are many
seemingly superfluous target names, either out of necessity or for
convenience.
